# Kongoh

Kongoh (named after the Japanese word “mixture”) is an open-source software for the interpretation of DNA profiles derived from DNA mixtures and small DNA samples. Kongoh is based on a quantitative continuous model, which considers the peak height information. The software is a graphical user interface written in R language.

## Getting started

* 1.  Ensure that R software is installed. It is available from the R Development Core Team website (http://www.R-project.org).
* 2.  Download the "Source code (zip)" of Kongoh, which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/manabe0322/Kongoh/releases).
* 3.  Decompress the downloaded file.
* 4.  Begin an R session.
* 5.  Load the “.RData” file from “Load Workspace” in the “File” tab.
* 6.  Execute the following command in R:

```r
Kongoh()
```
